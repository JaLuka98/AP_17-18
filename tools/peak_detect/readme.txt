this very easy python script can detect peaks very comfortably.
To use:
- Open up console and type 'pip install peakdetect'. If this does not work, then download peakdetect directly: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PeakUtils
- Otherwise the script is pretty self-explanatory. thres is the threshold for maxima, min_dist is the minimum distance beetween peaks

To search for minima simply search for maxima of the negative inverse data.
The script is provided with samples to demonstrate its use.
